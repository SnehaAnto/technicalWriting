The Aral Sea disaster highlights several missed opportunities where alternative strategies could have minimized the environmental and socioeconomic impacts. A more sustainable
approach might have included:

\section{Efficient Irrigation Techniques}
The inefficient, unlined irrigation canals used by the Soviet Union resulted in significant water loss through evaporation and seepage. In contrast, drip irrigation is a more efficient method that delivers water directly to the plant roots, minimizing evaporation and runoff \autocite{uri_drip}. This precision watering technique would have been particularly beneficial for cotton cultivation, which requires a substantial amount of water but is sensitive to over-irrigation \autocite{cotton2025water}. Drip irrigation not only conserves water but also ensures that water is used more efficiently, directly supporting crop growth and improving yields without overburdening the water supply.

\section{Climate-Appropriate Crops}
The extensive focus on cotton, a highly water-intensive crop, placed unsustainable pressure on the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers. Shifting to drought-resistant, climate-appropriate
crops such as wheat, barley, or sorghum would have reduced water consumption while better aligning with the region's arid conditions \autocite{lodhi2020wheat}\autocite{chadalavada2022sorghum}. These crops require less water and are more resilient to extreme weather conditions, improving both soil health and long-term agricultural productivity. By diversifying crop choices, the region could have reduced its dependence on water-intensive monocultures, mitigating the environmental impact on the rivers and ensuring more sustainable agricultural practices \autocite{rustamova2023crop}.

\section{Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs)}
Despite the implementation of EIAs in the Aral Sea region, the findings were not adequately integrated into policy decisions, which led to the underestimation of the long-term environmental consequences of water diversion projects \autocite{frederick1991disappearing}. A more rigorous and action-oriented application of EIAs could have highlighted critical risks such as soil salinization, declining biodiversity, and the irreversible shrinking of the Aral Sea. These assessments should have been used not only to identify risks but also to actively inform water management strategies that prioritized ecosystem health. Had the EIAs been employed to their full potential, they could have provided a blueprint for sustainable agricultural practices and water usage, which would have alleviated many of the adverse environmental effects
observed today.

\section{Adaptive Water Governance}
The centralized and rigid water management system adopted by the Soviet Union lacked the flexibility required to adapt to changing environmental conditions. This inflexibility led to a
systematic over-allocation of water to agriculture, without taking into account the long-term ecological limits of the river systems. In contrast, adaptive water governanceâ€”characterized
by continuous monitoring, data-driven decision-making, and the flexibility to adjust policies as conditions evolve, could have provided a mechanism for managing fluctuating water resources while safeguarding ecological health. Such an approach would have enabled the region to better absorb environmental shocks, ensuring that water resources were allocated efficiently across agricultural, ecological, and human needs, thus preventing the devastating ecological decline seen in the Aral Sea \autocite{sharipova2022adaptive}.

\section{Gradual Scaling with Community Engagement}
The large-scale, top-down implementation of irrigation projects without adequate local involvement or phased planning led to significant ecological and social disruptions. A more gradual, community-centered approach to water management would have allowed for better integration of local knowledge and environmental feedback, ensuring that water usage patterns were sustainable. Engaging local communities in decision-making would have fostered greater accountability and allowed for the adoption of water-conserving practices that aligned with local agricultural traditions. Moreover, scaling irrigation projects gradually would have provided the flexibility to assess ecological impacts at each stage and make necessary adjustments to minimize adverse effects, ultimately leading to more sustainable water resource management \autocite{micklin2007disaster}.


Had these strategies been implemented early on, they could have preserved both the region's ecosystem and its agricultural productivity, leading to a more sustainable future.
